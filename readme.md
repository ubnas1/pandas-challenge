                                    ------------


In this project, I have perofrmed analysis on the data of 15 schools in a local government area.

The data contains Maths scores and Reading scores of all students of these schools.

                    Brief Summary of my work in this project
                    ----------------------------------------

As my first step, I imported required dependencies. After that I made a DataFrame by combining the two sets of data I recieved to perform analysis.

Second step was to extract the total number of schools and total number of students. After getting them, I calculated total budget, average math and reading scores and percentage of students who have passed the result. Then I stored the data in a DataFrame for future use.

Then I applied different functions including set_index() and groupby() to find results of each school. Some results include Total School Budget, Per Student Budget, % Overall Passing etc.

Then using the above mentioned results, I found the Top performing schools and worst performing schools.

Then I calculated Maths and Reading scores by year 9, 10, 11 and 12 year students.

After that I calculated student scores by school size,  school spending and school types.

                                Findings and Pattern Analysis
                                -----------------------------

By carefully looking at the analysis, I have come to the conclusion that Independent schools are generally performing better than government schools. As we can clearly see in the Top performing schools category that there are 7 Indepedent schools and only 2 Government schools in top 9 performing schools by overall pass % category.

It came as a surprise to me after finding that, as average spending per student is increased the average score is decreased.

Another pattern we can see is that, smaller the school size (number of students enrolled) the better the result they produce.
